% QBUS3350 Project Planning and Management
% BUSS1040 Economics for Business Decision Making

Computer system students will focus more on data analysis and processing, and use programming languages for big data processing. For students of Information systems, if the analytical skills and business skills are combined, it may bring more advantages in the future competition. Based on the above thoughts, I think QBUS3350 and BUSS1040 in the Business and Commerce area are suitable as electives.

The full name of QBUS3350 is Project Planning and Management, this course focuses on teaching students the ability to plan, implement and manage activities to achieve specific organizational goals, and discuss the challenges that project managers may encounter. BUSS1040 is a compulsory course for the Department of Finance, which full name is called Economics for Business Decision Making, it teaches students basic business knowledge and decision-making, as well as interaction in the market. Students majoring in information systems have certain data analysis skills, advanced mathematical and logical thinking skills and the ability to write codes, and they will have the ability to operate, manage and make decisions on the system in the future. I will analyze the advantages of the two elective subjects to explain why it is suitable for students of information systems to study.

QBUS3350 course will teach students the ability to plan, implement and manage activities. Under normal circumstances, students majoring in information systems will be more inclined to perform database operation and maintenance management. After learning this course, they can participate in the product planning process. For any database product, performance is particularly important. Databases are usually designed by architects, and unreasonable basic database structure design can lead to hidden dangers in system performance. After the amount of data increases, the performance and stability of the database begin to decline, which will directly affect the response speed and user experience of the product. If personnel with organizational skills and operation and maintenance capabilities are planned in the early stage of the design, it will save a lot of time and money for maintaining the database in the later stages. On the other hand, another advantage of studying this course is that it broadens the scope of work, it can provide students with the knowledge base as a project manager. According to Miller in 2019, the responsibility of the project manager is to organize the plan, and to ensure that these projects are carried out on time, within the budget and within the scope. The responsibility of the project manager is to organize the plan, and to ensure that these projects are carried out on time, within the budget and within the scope. Through the planning process, the project manager can make the project run reasonably, thereby helping to reduce costs, maximize company efficiency and increase revenue. And this job has certain market demand, by 2027, the role demand for project management will reach 87.7 million, according to the article on Payscale website, the average annual salary of a project manager is \$88,825, which is higher than the database administrator's 73,458 U.S. dollar. Even if it is only used as an additional study, learning management can also allow students to better understand the overall situation of their work, thereby making the work more planned, improving work efficiency and making themselves more competitive.

In recent years, business is inseparable from the support of financial knowledge. Financial experts will provide companies with strategic decisions, and this decision will bring benefits or losses to the company, the principles of management economics are designed to influence and guide the company to obtain the best results (“A Definition and Explanation of Business Economics,” 2019). BUSS1040 course will teach students how person purchasers and companies make selections and the way they have interaction in markets, it also uses a framework for students to understand and analyze the economic and public policy environment in the context of corporate competition (“Unit,” n.d.). Information system students have the ability to manage a large amount of information in the database by operating programming languages such as SQL, and also because of the foundation of data science and mathematics, their ability to analyze data also has certain advantages. The knowledge provided by this elective course provides information system students with the career direction of business analysts. Business analysts are responsible for collecting and analyzing independent projects, proposing targeted plans and recommendations, and building a business analysis framework for specific business topics. Due to the improvement of computer computing power, it provides convenient conditions for big data analysis. By processing these data and combining business analysis, it can predict market trends and help companies make decisions. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports that the median annual salary of management analysts in 2020 is \$87,660. The highest income earners earn much more, and the top 10\% earn more than \$156,840. Studying business undoubtedly gives students more choices and the possibility to try another field of work.

Taking these two subjects as elective courses also lays the foundation for later learning and higher positions. These two cross-professional courses are relatively basic courses in business, learning these two courses provides students with another choice after they are tired of studying engineering. Furthermore, after having the foundation of these two management and business, students will have the opportunity to try higher-level knowledge, such as learning a master of business administration, and then can play a greater role in management positions at work, such as becoming a chief information officer (CIO). The Chief Information Officer (CIO) is a company executive responsible for the management, implementation and availability of information and computer technology, CIO must use multiple skills to be competent for this job. This position needs to know how to conduct business, because this job requires a lot of knowledge about the way the company operates up and down, and it should also understand technology trends of information technology, so companies usually require CIOs to have a bachelor's degree in related fields, such as computer science, database management, etc. (Kenton, 2019), the job requirements explain the necessity of these two courses. The CIO is the same as other CXO positions, almost at the top of the company's career, and correspondingly, there are high salary returns, according to The US Bureau of Labor Statistics the 2020 Median Pay of CIO is \$151,150 per year.

In conclusion, learning the two courses QBUS 3350 and BUSS1040 will teach students the basic knowledge of management and business, and give students more choices in academic and work. Students can no longer be limited to technical positions such as database management, so that they can look for jobs in analysis and management positions. Finally, learning these two courses also lays the foundation for a higher level of learning, and all-round development can gain more competitive advantages in today's society.
