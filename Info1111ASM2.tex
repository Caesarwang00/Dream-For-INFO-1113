\section{Recommendations}

\subsection{Computer Science}

  I chose Medicine and Agriculture.The reasons are simple, but mainly include two things.
First, the two courses cover a wide range of subjects, and second, they are both practical
subjects.

These two elective courses have a lot of applications, whether it is hospital medical system,
or automated farm management can not be separated from computer science.The hospital health care
system is faced with a large number of patients every day, including the elderly, young and
children.The level of education of these patients is different, which makes the procedure readability
a requirement.So the person writing the program naturally has to have a certain amount of medical
knowledge, because they have to have that knowledge before they can explain it in plain English to
others.And then there's Agriculture. For example, when you're writing programs for automated cotton
growing, when to sprinkle water, what humidity and temperature to keep in the greenhouse, and so on.
These are things that need to be taken into account and written into the program, which brings up
the need to have an understanding of agriculture.
