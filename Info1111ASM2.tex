\section{Recommendations}

\subsection{Computer Science}


\subsection{Data Science}


\subsection{Information Systems}
% QBUS3350 Project Planning and Management
% BUSS1040 Economics for Business Decision Making

Computer system students will focus more on data analysis and processing, and use programming languages for big data processing. For students of Information systems, if the analytical skills and business skills are combined, it may bring more advantages in the future competition. Based on the above thoughts, I think QBUS3350 and BUSS1040 in the Business and Commerce area are suitable as electives.





\subsection{Software Development}

\section{Conclusion}
