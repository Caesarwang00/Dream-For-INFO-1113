INFO1111 Group3 Assignment 2B

# Description
## Overview
This assignment is designed to help you understand the different non-computing available elective courses and demonstrate your understanding and skills of Git and LaTeX.

Project 2B will be carried out in the 7th to the 12th week and is only applicable to students who have reached level 1 in the course. Project 1 (although these students can also choose to carry out Project 2A). The project will require good teamwork, teamwork spirit and strong practical ability.

## Background

As a group, you need to study the University of Sydney and make recommendations on which non-computer elective subjects are most suitable for students in each of the four main majors.

#### As a team,

1. Research the different elective courses available
2. Determine two elective courses for each of the four computing majors from other places in the university, which is most suitable for students of the four majors to study
3. Assign a major to each team member

#### As an individual,

Each team member needs to explain why the two selected electives may be the most suitable (ie most relevant and useful) to be selected as part of the Badvcomputing degree and as a student in the designated major (for those with a double degree).

You will need to create a report written in LaTeX. This requires storing a set of LaTeX files in a shared git repository: these files will include

-The master file containing the shared elements of the report `master` (an introduction; the inclusion of each separate recommendation section; a section on the donation overview of how the group is managed; and a bibliography)` (an introduction; the inclusion of each separate recommendation section; a section on contributions outlining
  how the group was managed; and a bibliography)`. All members of the group need to contribute to this.
-A separate set of "recommended" files (one for each student). `a set of individual “recommendation” files (one for each student). `The recommended part of each member’s contribution will require 1000-2000 words, and it should be stated on which basis elective subjects are considered most suitable for students in a given major s Choice.

### step 1:

The University of Sydney offers many different elective courses. These elective courses come from different fields, such as

-Architecture and interaction design

-Arts and Social Sciences

-Business and commerce

-Education and social work

-Engineering and Computer Science

-Hygiene, medicine and dentistry

-Music

-Science, agriculture, environment and veterinary science.

  As a team, study the different elective courses offered in these areas.

### Step 2:

Once your team has studied the different electives offered in these fields, please choose the two non-computing electives that are most suitable for students studying in each major.

-Consider which field these elective courses come from
-Consider what is an elective course
-Consider what knowledge and abilities will be developed through these activities as elective courses
-Consider how these elective courses supplement knowledge and abilities as part of the development of related majors
-Consider whether the knowledge and abilities gained by taking these elective courses will assist you in your career
-Consider whether there are any opportunities to participate in these elective courses

**Elective courses should be selected according to the degree to which they can provide the greatest benefit to students in a particular major. **



### Step 3:

-Determine the profession assigned to each team member. Your team will have to work together to determine who will be assigned which major. **This does not have to be the major you are studying**. Provide a table summarizing the majors assigned to each team member.

  ### Step 4:

  As an individual, each team member will need to explain why the two selected elective courses may be the most suitable (ie most relevant and useful) to be selected as part of the Badvcomputing degree and as a student of the designated major (for dual-degree students) ).

  -Consider which field these elective courses come from
  -Consider what is an elective course
  -Consider what knowledge and abilities will be developed through these activities as elective courses
  -Consider how these elective courses supplement knowledge and abilities as part of the development of related majors
  -Consider whether the knowledge and abilities gained by taking these elective courses will assist you in your career
  -Consider whether there are any opportunities to participate in these elective courses

  ## Git commands

  Your team should create a shared git repository for report generation. Each team member should demonstrate the following abilities:

-Clone the repository so that files can be processed locally

-Extract any changes made by other members of the `git pull` group, and extract any changes made by other members of the group to keep its local copy up to date

-Push any changes they make to the main repository so that they can be shared with others

-**For level 3 or higher, you should also be able to prove:**

  -Ability to create a separate branch `Branch` so that changes can be made without changes affecting the master branch `Master(main)`
  -Resolve conflicts during the merge `conflict`

## Additional Information

### Submit content
Your submission should include:

-Access to your git repository so that various branches, commits, etc. can be evaluated
-Submit your final report via canvas

### Levels

-To meet the level 1 requirements, basic git and LaTeX functions and basic case studies are required.

-To reach the level 2 level, basic git and powerful LaTeX are required, and case studies are used to prove its rationality.
-Reaching level 3 requires strong git skills (merging, proper use locally, etc.), strong LaTeX and excellent case studies.
-To reach level 4, you need to have all the requirements of level 3, and you must have excellent insight into the nature of the relevant profession and excellent teamwork.
# 描述
## 概述
这项作业旨在帮助您了解不同的非计算可用的选修课，展示您对Git和LaTeX的理解和技能。

项目2B将在第7周到第12周进行，仅适用于在该课程中达到1级的学生项目1（尽管这些学生也可以选择进行项目2A）。该项目将需要良好的团队合作，团队合作精神和较强的实践能力。

## 背景

作为一个小组，您需要研究悉尼大学，并就哪些非计算机选修科目提出建议最适合于学习四个主要专业中的每个专业的学生。

#### 作为一个团队，

1. 研究可用的不同选修课
2. 从大学其他地方为四个计算专业中的每一个确定两个选修课大学，最适合四个专业的学生学习
3. 为每个团队成员分配一个专业

#### 作为个人，

每个团队成员都需要说明为什么两个选定的选修课可能会最适合（即最相关和最有用）被选为Badvcomputing学位的一部分并作为指定专业的学生(对于双学位的人)。

您将需要创建一个用LaTeX编写的报告。这需要将一组LaTeX文件存储在共享git信息库：这些文件将包括

- 包含报告共享元素的主文件 `master`（简介；包括每个单独的推荐部分；关于捐款概述的部分该小组的管理方式；和参考书目）`(an introduction; the inclusion of each separate recommendation section; a section on contributions outlining
  how the group was managed; and a bibliography)`。该组的所有成员都需要为此做出贡献。
- 一组单独的“推荐”文件（每个学生一个）。`a set of individual “recommendation” files (one for each student). `每个成员贡献的推荐部分将需要1000-2000字，并应说明在哪些基础上选修科目被认为是给定专业的学生最合适的选择。

### 步骤1：

悉尼大学提供许多不同的选修课。这些选修课来自不同的领域，例如

- 架构与交互设计

- 艺术与社会科学

- 商业和商务

- 教育和社会工作

- 工程与计算机科学

- 卫生，医学和牙科

-  音乐

- 科学，农业，环境和兽医科学。

  作为一个团队，研究在这些领域提供的不同选修课。

### 步骤2:

一旦您的团队研究了这些领域提供的不同选修课，请选择两种最适合每个专业学习的学生的非计算选修课。

- 考虑这些选修课来自哪个领域
- 考虑什么是选修课
- 考虑通过开展这些活动将开发哪些知识和能力选修课
- 考虑这些选修课如何补充知识和能力作为相关专业的一部分开发
- 考虑通过参加这些选修课而获得的知识和能力是否会协助您的职业生涯
- 考虑参加这些选修课是否有任何机会

**选修课程时应根据他们能为特定专业的学生提供最大利益的程度进行选择。**



### 步骤3:

- 确定分配给每个团队成员的专业。 您的团队将必须共同努力，确定将为谁分配哪个专业。 **这不必是您正在学习的专业**。 提供一个表格，汇总分配给每个团队成员的专业。

  ### 步骤4:

  作为个人，每个团队成员都将需要说明为什么两个选定的选修课可能会最适合（即最相关和最有用）被选为Badvcomputing学位的一部分并作为指定专业的学生(对于双学位的人)。

  - 考虑这些选修课来自哪个领域
  - 考虑什么是选修课
  - 考虑通过开展这些活动将开发哪些知识和能力选修课
  - 考虑这些选修课如何补充知识和能力作为相关专业的一部分开发
  - 考虑通过参加这些选修课而获得的知识和能力是否会协助您的职业生涯
  - 考虑参加这些选修课是否有任何机会

  ## Git指令

  您的团队应创建一个共享的git存储库，以用于生成报告。每个小组成员应证明具有以下能力：

- 克隆存储库，以便可以在本地处理文件

- 提取 `git pull` 组中其他成员所做的任何更改，提取组中其他成员所做的任何更改，以使其本地副本保持最新状态

- 将他们所做的任何更改推送到主存储库，以便可以与他人共享

- **对于3级或更高级别，您还应该能够证明：**

  - 能够创建单独的分支 `Branch`，以便无需更改即可进行更改影响主分支`Master(main)`
  - 解决合并期间发生的冲突`conflict`

## 附加信息

### 提交内容
您的提交应包括：

- 访问您的git存储库，以便可以评估各种分支，提交等
- 通过画布(canvas)提交您的最终报告
